# crud
SDI Z prefix app

to run the app I :
CD'ed into frontend file and spm start
in seprate terminal CD'ed into Backend file and npm start
with docker extension installed in VSCode right click on docker-compose.yaml and "run docker compse up"

alternate methods
(ie docker run --rm --name pg-docker -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -d -p 5433:5432\ -v $HOME/docker/volumes/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres) of running database may be possible but your mileage may vary

currently when you create a new item and it instatly links you to the user inventory page the new item isnt shown
not 100% how to fix but if i have time i will try, it does show up if you hit home and then back to the inventory

seems to be an issue with the deployed site with logins but the local build functioned
